# ip

Ip is a powerful network configuration tool in the iproute2 package, which can replace some traditional network management tools. For example: ifconfig, route, etc.

```text
# ip [options] [actions] [commands]
# actions := { link | addr | route | rule | neigh | tunnel | maddr | mroute | monitor }
# options := { -V[ersion] | -s[tatistics] | -r[esolve] |-f[amily] { inet | inet6 | ipx | dnet | link } | -o[neline] }

```
