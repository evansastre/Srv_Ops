# STP

## Spanning Tree Protocol <a id="firstHeading"></a>

The **Spanning Tree Protocol** \(**STP**\) is a [network protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol) that builds a loop-free [logical topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_topology) for [Ethernet networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_network). The basic function of STP is to prevent [bridge loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_loop) and the [broadcast radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_radiation) that results from them. Spanning tree also allows a [network design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_planning_and_design) to include backup links to provide [fault tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tolerance) if an active link fails.
