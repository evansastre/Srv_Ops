ã€€**Link Aggregation Control Protocol \(LACP\)**

In [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking), the term **link aggregation** applies to various methods of combining \([aggregating](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aggregation)\) multiple network connections in parallel in order to increase [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput) beyond what a single connection could sustain, and to provide [redundancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_%28engineering%29)in case one of the links should fail. A Link Aggregation Group \(LAG\) combines a number of physical ports together to make a single high-bandwidth data path, so as to implement the traffic load sharing among the member ports in the group and to enhance the connection reliability.
